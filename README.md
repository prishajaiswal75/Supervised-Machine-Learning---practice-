# Supervised Machine Learning — Practice 

This repository contains my complete lab work, practice notebooks, and experiments for **Supervised Machine Learning (SML)**.  
It includes hands-on implementations of core ML algorithms for **regression** and **classification**, along with dataset exploration and evaluation techniques.


##  Topics Covered

### **Regression**
- Simple Linear Regression  
- Multiple Linear Regression  
- Polynomial Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- Lasso Regression  
- KNN (Regression)

### **Classification**
- Logistic Regression  
- KNN Classification  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- Decision Trees  
- Random Forest  
- Bagging, Boosting & Ensemble Methods  
- Naive Bayes Classification

##  What You Will Find in the Notebooks
✔ Step-by-step ML model building  
✔ Data preprocessing & visualization  
✔ Train–test split and cross-validation  
✔ Evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)  
✔ Intuition + implementation + interpretation  
✔ Real datasets and hands-on examples
